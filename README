Architecture is MVC where there are essentially two "viewers", audio output and 
the sequencer GUI that observe the state of the model via the observer pattern.

the controller has a thread that updates the current beat, triggering a callback
to update the GUI current beat as well as a callback to trigger audio out for 
any active samples

clicks on the grid trigger a callback to the controller which updates the model
the observables in the model trigger a listening callback in the controller which
updates the GUI 


Thoughts:
    - wondering where the logic for updating the current beat should live, controller or model
