usage: python sequencer_controller.py [relative_path_to_sample_folder]

the program will automatically load all .wav files from the sample folder

for example, "python sequencer_controller.py samples" directs the program to the samples folder included in the repository

audio out relies on pygame, but the program defaults to console output if pygame cannot be imported
